          VIRTUAL NETWORK
A Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure is a logically isolated network that you can use to securely connect Azure resources to each other, to the internet, and to on-premises networks. It provides an isolated environment where you can run and manage your virtual machines (VMs) and other resources.

Key features of Azure Virtual Network include:

1. **Isolation and Segmentation**: VNets provide isolation from other networks, allowing you to create a secure environment for your resources. You can also segment your network into subnets to organize and secure your resources.

2. **Connectivity**: VNets enable you to connect Azure resources to each other, to the internet, and to on-premises networks using various connectivity options such as VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, and VNet Peering.

3. **Security**: You can use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources. Additionally, you can use Azure Firewall and other security services to protect your network.

4. **Scalability**: VNets can scale to accommodate your growing network needs. You can add or remove resources, subnets, and connectivity options as needed.

5. **Integration**: VNets integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway, and Azure DNS, to provide a comprehensive networking solution.

Example use cases for Azure Virtual Network include:
- Hosting web applications and databases in a secure and isolated environment.
- Connecting on-premises networks to Azure for hybrid cloud scenarios.
- Creating development and test environments that mimic your production network.
- Implementing disaster recovery solutions by replicating on-premises resources to Azure.

        
        LOAD BALANCER
A Load Balancer in Azure is a service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) or other resources to ensure high availability and reliability of your applications. It helps to balance the load, prevent any single resource from being overwhelmed, and improve the overall performance and availability of your applications.

  There are two main types of load balancers in Azure:
Public Load Balancer: Distributes incoming internet traffic to your VMs or resources in a specific region.
Internal Load Balancer: Distributes traffic within a virtual network (VNet), useful for balancing traffic between internal services.

    DOMAIN NETWORKING SERVICE
Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

     FIREWALL
***Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It is a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.


           GATEWAY
***An Azure Virtual Network Gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. It can also be used to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network.
