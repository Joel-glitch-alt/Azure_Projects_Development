What is Nexus?
Nexus refers to Sonatype Nexus, a popular repository manager used for storing, organizing, and distributing software artifacts (like libraries, dependencies, Docker images, and npm packages). It is widely used in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines to manage binary components efficiently.

Types of Nexus Repositories
Nexus supports multiple repository formats:

Maven (Java/JVM) – For .jar, .pom, and other Java artifacts.

npm (Node.js) – For JavaScript packages.

Docker – For container images.

PyPI (Python) – For Python packages.

NuGet (.NET) – For .NET libraries.

Raw/Binary – For generic files (e.g., installers, scripts).

Key Features of Nexus Repository Manager
✔ Proxy Repositories – Cache external dependencies (e.g., Maven Central, npm registry).
✔ Hosted Repositories – Store your private/internal artifacts.
✔ Group Repositories – Combine multiple repos into a single endpoint.
✔ Security & Access Control – Role-based permissions, LDAP integration.
✔ CI/CD Integration – Works with Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub Actions, etc.
✔ Dependency Scanning – Detects vulnerabilities (via Nexus IQ).

Nexus vs. Other Repository Managers
Tool	Type	Key Strengths
Nexus (Sonatype)	Universal (Maven, npm, Docker, etc.)	Enterprise-grade, security scanning (IQ)
JFrog Artifactory	Universal	High scalability, cloud-native
Apache Archiva	Maven-focused	Lightweight, open-source
GitHub Packages	Cloud-based	Tight GitHub integration
Nexus IQ vs. Nexus Repository
Nexus Repository → Manages artifacts (like a private Maven/NPM/Docker repo).

Nexus IQ → Advanced security & compliance scanning (checks for vulnerabilities, licenses, and policies).

Use Cases
Enterprise Dependency Management – Avoid "dependency hell" by centralizing libraries.

Secure CI/CD Pipelines – Scan for vulnerabilities before deployment.

Air-Gapped Environments – Host internal dependencies offline.

Docker Private Registry – Store custom container images securely
