# What is SonarQube?

SonarQube is an open-source platform designed for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs automatic reviews of code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in over 25 programming languages. SonarQube integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, providing actionable insights to improve code maintainability, reliability, and security.

## Key Features
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Identifies issues like bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, and more.
- **Integration**: Works with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Actions.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows configuration of quality profiles and rules to suit project needs.
- **Visualization**: Provides dashboards and reports for tracking code quality trends.

SonarQube is widely used by development teams to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and secure codebases.



SonarQube directory files based on the search. Since the user wants examples of SonarQube code, I will provide typical examples of SonarQube configuration and usage, such as a sample sonar-project.properties file and example of integrating SonarQube in a CI pipeline.


Task Completed
Here are some examples of SonarQube code and configuration:

Example sonar-project.properties file (used to configure a SonarQube analysis for a project):

# Required metadata
sonar.projectKey=my_project_key
sonar.projectName=My Project
sonar.projectVersion=1.0

# Path to source directories
sonar.sources=src

# Language of the project
sonar.language=java

# Encoding of the source files
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
Example of running SonarQube scanner from the command line:

sonar-scanner \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project_key \
  -Dsonar.sources=src \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=your_sonarqube_token

  
Example of integrating SonarQube analysis in a Jenkins pipeline (Declarative Pipeline syntax):

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build steps here
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            steps {
                withSonarQubeEnv('My SonarQube Server') {
                    sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Quality Gate') {
            steps {
                timeout(time: 1, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                    waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
                }
            }
        }
    }
